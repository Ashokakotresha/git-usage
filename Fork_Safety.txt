# GIT FORK SAFETY CHEAT SHEET
This file is for working with a forked GitHub repository where:

* origin   -> your fork (Ashokakotresha)
* upstream -> original repository (Others, Repo from where you Forked)
---

1. VERIFY REMOTES (WHO IS WHO)

Command:
  git remote -v

Expected:
origin   -> your GitHub repo
upstream -> original source repo

2. CHECK WHICH REPO YOUR BRANCH TRACKS

Command:
  git branch -vv

Interpretation:
  [origin/main]   -> SAFE (your fork)
  [upstream/main] -> ORIGINAL REPO (be careful)

3. PULL ONLY YOUR CHANGES (DAILY USE)
Command:
  git pull origin main

  This pulls commits only from your fork.

4. PROVE YOUR COMMITS ARE NOT IN UPSTREAM
Commands:
  git fetch upstream
  git log upstream/main..HEAD --oneline

Result:
  * Shows commits that exist ONLY in your fork

Reverse check (what upstream has that you don’t):
  git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline

5. SYNC YOUR FORK WITH ORIGINAL REPO (INTENTIONAL)
Commands:
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main

Alternative (linear history):
  git rebase upstream/main

6. CHECK WHERE CHANGES CAME FROM (AUDIT TRAIL)
Command:
  git reflog

Look for:
  pull origin   -> changes from your fork
  pull upstream -> changes from original repo

7. OPTIONAL SAFETY LOCK (RECOMMENDED)
Prevent accidental pushes to upstream:
  git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED

  Now pushing to upstream will fail by default.

8. QUICK HEALTH CHECK (FASTEST)
Commands:
  git status
  git branch -vv

## MENTAL MODEL (REMEMBER THIS)

* Pull from origin   -> your work
* Fetch/Merge upstream -> original project
* Never push to upstream
